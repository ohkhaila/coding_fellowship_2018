    <h1>Hey Ladi Dadi! We Love Our Bodies</h1>
    <h3>Love. Food. Fitness.</h3>
    <p>
         Three simple words that I have been using to improve my physical health and body image.
          Focusing on these three ideals in relation to my body has changed my understanding of
          what I want for my own pesonal health. Hopefully, these ideals will be of use to you as well.
            Start with love. Everything that you do for yourself needs to start with love for yourself
            and your growth. You appreciate your victories and have a reason to fight through your toughest battles.
            Without it, you allow negative things, people, and thoughts to influence your decisions because
            it's easyh to forget what you're fighting for. Self love is a great reminder. </br>
