        <h1>My thoughts on the weather</h1>
        <p> I don't like it when it's too hot. I also don't like it when it's too cold.
            Despite my allergies and ashtma, I LOVE being outdoors. When it is warm out I like to go on walks in the park. When the weather is perfect (about 75 degrees) the best place for me to be is at the Boat House in Forest Park or in a canoe on Creve Coeur lake.
        The outdoors have become a place where I find tranquilty. When the weather is nice</p>
